### What is Algorithm?
    An algorithm is a step by step procedure to solve a problem.

#### - Characteristics of algorithm
* **Finiteness** - A loop should not go infinite, it should stop when a criteria is met
* **Definiteness** - Each step is defined and unambiguous
* **Input** - Should have 0 or more inputs
* **Output** - Should have 1 or more outputs
* **Effectiveness** - each step carried should contribute towards the solution and should not have unnecessary steps
